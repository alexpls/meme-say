# Alex Says custom Slack Slash 


## Intro
- I just wanted to fool around and see if i could get slack slash commands working

- requires `graphicsmagick`

## Getting started

- install `graphicsmagick`
- run `yarn` or `npm install`

## Things to do but too lazy right now

- add a linter dammit
- Typescript this up - it would be great to type the command that slacks sends and re-use this for future slack stuff.
- Add auth to only allow specific Slack spaces
